# 1. Lack of input validation: The code does not perform any validation on the URL provided by the user, which can lead to an injection attack.
# For example, an attacker could provide a URL with malicious code as a parameter, which could be executed on the server when the request is made.
# Piece of code: url = request.args.get('url', '') Problem: This code allows the user to input any URL, which can potentially be malicious and cause harm to the server.
