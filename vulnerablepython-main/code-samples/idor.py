# InstructLLM response:
# 1. Lack of input validation: The code does not perform any validation on the username and note_index inputs received from the user.
# This can allow an attacker to inject malicious data into the system, leading to unintended behavior or data corruption.
# For example, an attacker could send a request to view a note for a non-existent user with a note_index larger than the number of notes for the existing users, causing the code to raise an index out of range error.
# 2. Lack of authentication: The code does not require the user to authenticate themselves before accessing the /view_note endpoint. This means that any user can access this endpoint and view other users(' notes, potentially revealing sensitive information. '
