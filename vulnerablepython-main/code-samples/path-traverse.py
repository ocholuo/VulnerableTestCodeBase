##InstructLLM response:
# 1. Path traversal vulnerability: The read_file function allows user input to be passed as the filename parameter, which can be used to traverse up the directory tree and access sensitive files outside of the expected directory.
# Quote: full_path = base_dir + filename. Problem: A malicious user could potentially use this vulnerability to access sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.
# 2. Insecure string concatenation: The full_path variable is constructed by concatenating the base_dir and filename variables using the + operator.
# This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the full_path variable if the filename parameter is not properly sanitized. Quote: full_path = base_dir + filename.
# Problem: This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious strings into the full_path variable.
