##InstructLLM response:
# 1. Lack of input validation: The code does not perform any validation on the file upload input, allowing the user to upload any file type, including potentially malicious ones. The problematic line is: file = request.files['file']
# 2. Lack of output encoding: The code does not properly encode the output when displaying the filename, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the page. The problematic line is: return redirect(url_for('upload_success', filename=filename))
# 3. Debug mode enabled: The code runs in debug mode, which can potentially expose sensitive information and make the application more vulnerable to attacks. The problematic line is: app.run(debug=True)
